          <h2>5. Other questions</h2>
          <h3>Do you offer a referral program? How does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            We have created a referral program to thank our customers for
            referring their friends and family.
          </p>
          <p>
            To refer someone, you will first need to have an account on our
            online store. After that you can head to your profile page to get
            your personalized referral link.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any of your friend who decides to place their first order using your
            referral link will get enjoy a 20â¬ discount. In return you will be
            credited to 20â¬ too for helping us spread the word.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information, please refer to our referral program terms
            &amp; conditions.
